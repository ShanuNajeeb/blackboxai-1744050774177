## Dependencies
This project uses the following external libraries (not included in a `package.json` since it is a static site):
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

```
blackbox-ai-landing-page/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file for landing page
├── styles.css          # Custom styles for the landing page
└── particles-config.js  # Configuration for Particles.js animation
```

### Notes
- The CSS styles are encapsulated in `styles.css` which applies styles to various elements throughout the page, including the navbar, buttons, and feature cards.
- The animations and interactivity are powered by `particles-config.js`, which configures the behavior and appearance of the particles in the background.
